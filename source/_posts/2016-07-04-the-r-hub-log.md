title: The r-hub log

Welcome to the r-hub log. r-hub is a project to build infrastructure
for R users. See more about it in the
[project proposal](https://github.com/r-hub/proposal).

## About this log

This log serves as a notebook for what is being done on r-hub.
I probably will not make an effort to make it very readable, and it will
be mostly technical.
