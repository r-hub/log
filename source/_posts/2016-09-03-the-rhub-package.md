The `rhub` R package
---

I have started to implement the `rhub` R package, to start builds from
within R. Its repository is now private, until it stabilizes a bit. Let me
know if you want to take an early peek at it.

It's UI needs a lot of improvements, but the streaming part works fine,
thanks to the streaming support of the `curl` R package.
